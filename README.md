# Py-Sicbo
It is a simulator for playing a famous game, which is with 3 dices, called sicbo


# First of all
The "Sicbo_Simulator.py" is where the game runs. Although you can simply run this file and do one bet per run, it's more recommanded to import it from another script and run the sicbo function there, because of better convenience


# How to do
"Sicbo_Simulator.py": Put it with the scripts that import this script. The sicbo(choice, money) is what you only need if you know the keyword for the "choice" parameter. However if you need to have a check, you can find the "methods" list which tells you the available choices

"Auto_Sicbo.py": Run it to simulate lots of games and finally print the overall results in a excel file.

"sicbo results demo.xlsx": This is the model of an excel file with the format that "Auto_Sicbo.py" prints the results with. You can copy, paste and rename it so that the "Auto_Sicbo.py" can print different sets of results

# Reminder
1. This project has licence. Remember to follow the licence if you wanna use my scripts.
2. The creator (me) was 14 years old when doing on this project. I was doing it because of my school summer holiday project. Yeah, Hong Kong schools offer such boring projects to students.
